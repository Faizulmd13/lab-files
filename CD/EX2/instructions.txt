# Lexical Analyzer using Lex/Flex (Quick Lab Sheet)
=========================================================

# Requirements
- Flex installed (Linux/Mac) or Windows with Cygwin/WSL  
- GCC installed  
- Terminal/Command Prompt  
- `input.txt` file present in the same directory

---

# Part 1: Compile
flex lexical.l
gcc lex.yy.c -o lexer

---

# Part 2: Run
./lexer

---

# Sample Terminal Execution

$ flex lexical.l
$ gcc lex.yy.c -o lexer
$ ./lexer

int => Keyword

# Notes
- Ensure `input.txt` is in the same folder as `lexical.l`  
- Flex generates `lex.yy.c` after running `flex lexical.l`  
- GCC compiles `lex.yy.c` into an executable `lexer`  
- The analyzer identifies keywords, identifiers, numbers, operators, strings, functions, special characters, and unknown symbols  
- Ctrl+C can be used to stop the program if needed
