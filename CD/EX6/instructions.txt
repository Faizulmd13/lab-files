# Simple Code Optimization (Quick Lab Sheet)
===================================================

# Requirements
- GCC installed (Linux/Mac/Windows with MinGW)  
- Terminal/Command Prompt  
- `codeoptimization.c` file in the same directory

---

# Part 1: Compile
gcc codeoptimization.c -o code

---

# Part 2: Run
./code

---

# Sample Terminal Execution

$ gcc codeoptimization.c -o code
$ ./code

Enter the Number of Values: 5
left: a
    right: b+c
left: b
    right: 2
left: c
    right: 3
left: d
    right: b+c
left: e
    right: a+d

Intermediate Code
a = b+c
b = 2
c = 3
d = b+c
e = a+d

After Dead Code Elimination
a = b+c
b = 2
c = 3
e = a+d

After Eliminating Common Expressions
a = b+c
b = 2
c = 3
e = a+a

---

# Notes
- Enter the number of assignments first, then input the left-hand variable and right-hand expression for each line.  
- The program performs:
  1. **Dead Code Elimination** – removes assignments that are never used.  
  2. **Common Subexpression Elimination** – removes redundant calculations.  
  3. **Algebraic Substitution** – replaces repeated expressions with existing variable values.  
- Ctrl+C can be used to stop the program if needed.  
- Maximum 10 assignments are supported in this implementation.
