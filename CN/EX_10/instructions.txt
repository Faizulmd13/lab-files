EX10 - CRC Generator & Checker (Quick Lab Sheet)
===============================================

# Requirements
- Java JDK installed
- Terminal/Command Prompt

---

# Part 1: Compile

javac CRC_Gen.java
# Note: Ignore any warnings unless there are errors

---

# Part 2: Run

java CRC_Gen

# Sample interaction:
Enter number of data bits:
7
Enter data bits:
1
0
1
1
0
0
1
Enter number of bits in divisor:
3
Enter divisor bits:
1
0
1
Dividend (after appending 0's) are: 101100100
CRC code: 
101100111
Enter CRC code of 9 bits:
1
0
1
1
0
0
1
0
1
CRC bits are: 101100101
Error
THANK YOU......

# Notes

- Enter each bit (0 or 1) one per line as prompted.
- After CRC code is generated, enter the received CRC code one bit per line for error checking.
- “No Error” means successful validation; “Error” means the data or CRC bits have been changed.
- To terminate the program, press Ctrl+C.
- You can run the code on Windows, Linux, or macOS if JDK is installed.
