## ▶️ How to Run

Each experiment folder typically contains:
- Java source files (`.java`)  
- A text file "instructions.txt" (providing inputs or explanations, varies by experiment)  

### General Execution Steps:
1. Navigate to the experiment folder, e.g.:
```bash
   cd EX1
```

2. Compile and Run the Java program(s):
   ```bash
   javac FileName.java
   java FileName
   ```
                          
3. Refer to the provided 'instructions.txt' in each folder for sample inputs or notes.

## ✅ Recommendation

- Always compile and run programs from the same folder where the .java files exist.
- Follow the instructions.txt for experiment-specific notes.
- For client-server programs, start the server before the client.

---

## ✅ Recommendation
- Always run these in a Linux environment for smooth execution.  
- Use the text file inside each experiment folder for input/output examples.
